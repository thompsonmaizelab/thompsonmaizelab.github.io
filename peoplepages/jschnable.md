James Schnable is an an Associate Professor in the Department of Agronomy at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, affiliated with both the Center for Plant Science Innovation, the Quantitative Life Sciences Initiative, and the [Nebraska Food for Health Center](https://foodforhealth.unl.edu/james-schnable). He earned a BA in Biology from Cornell University in 2008 and a PhD in Plant Biology from UC-Berkeley in 2012, working in the lab of Prof. Michael Freeling. Before starting his current position at Nebraska, he was an NSF Plant Genome Fellowship supported postdoc at the Danforth Center in St. Louis and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing China. Prof. Schnable's research focuses on using comparative genomics and both new high-throughput phenotyping and new quantitative genetic techniques to link genes to functions in maize, sorghum, and allied species. His lab is currently funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, The U.S. Department of Agriculture, ARPA-E, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, and private industry. In addition to his academic research, Prof. Schnable's work has lead him to participate in the founding of three different companies: [Data2Bio](https://www.data2bio.com/) (focused on genotyping and breeding decision support), [Dryland Genetics](http://www.drylandgenetics.com/) (breeding naturally water use efficient crops), and [EnGeniousAg](https://www.engeniousag.com/) (low cost nondestructive nutrient and water sensors for farmers), and he serves as a consultant or advisor to the scientific advisory boards of a number of larger companies in the agricultural and genomics sectors. Prof. Schnable won the [Macrus Rhoades Early Career Award in 2018](https://www.maizegdb.org/community/awards/maize_past_winners), the [North American Plant Phenotyping Network Early Career Award in 2019](http://nappn.plant-phenotyping.org/early-career-award-2019/), and the [American Society of Plant Biologists Early Career Award in 2019](https://blog.aspb.org/aspb-names-2019-award-recipients/).
