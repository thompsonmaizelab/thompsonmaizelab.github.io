### Heirloom maize jewelry

We have a fascination with colorful maize kernels! Using tiny drill bits, we drill holes in corn kernels to use them as beads in jewelry making. If you have received one of our pieces, feel free to send thank-yous to the makers and contribute images via email to Addie.

The heirloom seeds come from traditional varieties from throughout the United States. Learn more about scientific research applications of heirloom corn with the [Flint-Garcia lab at Mizzou](https://flint-garcias.mufaculty.umsystem.edu).
