# About me 
Dr. Anuradha is a postdoc in my lab. She obtained her Ph.D. from the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology jointly with National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, in India. Her research focuses on phenomics and genomic analyses of multiple agronomic and functional traits associated with biomass and climate resilience in sorghum. She leverages her study through exploiting natural genetic variations present in a sorghum association panel to resolve complex trait variations at both the genomic and phenotypic levels. She employs both manual and high-throughput phenotyping techniques, including physiological phenotyping, hyperspectral scanning, and multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle imaging, to phenotype sorghum plants at various growth stages across natural environmental conditions. Her research is crucial for predicting plant responses to specific environmental conditions, ensuring food security, and enhancing resilience in the face of climate change and evolving environmental challenges.
