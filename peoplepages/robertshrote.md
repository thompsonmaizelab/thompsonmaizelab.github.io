Robert completed his B.Sc in Plant Genetic, Breeding, and Biotechnology at Purdue University. He is studying the optimization of genomic selection and genomic mating in plant breeding under single- and multi-objective scenarios. He is developing novel selection and mating criteria and hopes to demonstrate their efficacy in real populations. Since many breeding optimization problems are NP-hard, he is also interested in assessing different algorithmic strategies for solving these problems. It is Robert's hope that his work will assist in decision-making for breeders and accelerate breeding efforts to provide for a growing world.
