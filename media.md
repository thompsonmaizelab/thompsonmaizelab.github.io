<p>Listen to James Schnable interviewed on the Peggy Smedley show on <a href="https://peggysmedleyshow.com/portfolio-items/05-22-18-episode-564-segment-2-iot-measures-and-manages-plants/">how the Internet of Things is changing agriculture</a>. </p>

<p>Prof. Schnable presents an our precently published paper with the Qiu and Xu statistics labs on using functional data analysis to analyze time series trait data, one of the big new challenges presented by HTP datasets.<br>

<p>2017, July, Professor Schnable and collaborators from Food for Health were quoted in <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/agriculture-new-center-aims-to-connect-crop-production-with-health/article_acbb7155-764c-52f5-9fbc-562e0fbfb2d6.html">this Lincoln Star article</a> which was picked up by papers around the country. (<a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Nebraska-Agriculture-center-seeks-to-link-crops-11290911.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article160784264.html">Charlotte Observer</a>)</p>

<p>2016, November, Our lab and our collaborators in the new food for health center featured in the "Adventures in Genomics" series sponsored by Illumina. Schnable lab research starts around 2:50 in the video.</p>

<p>2016, September <a href="http://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/study-in-contrasts-system-advances-analysis-of-corn/">Great write up in UNL today</a> by the always excellent Scott Schrage about our collaborative work with the Ge Lab on maize phenotyping.</p>

<p>2016, August "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aag1125">Integration of omic networks in a developmental atlas of maize</a>" led by Steve Briggs at UCSD and Justin Walley at ISU, is published in the journal Science. The Schnable lab's contribution to this paper focused on using data from multiple grass species to predict which genes will produce both RNA and protein and which genes will produce only RNA which is not translated into protein.
