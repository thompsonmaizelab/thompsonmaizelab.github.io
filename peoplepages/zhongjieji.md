Zhongjie Ji graduated from Shandong Agricultural University with a bachelor's degree in Agronomy and earned a Master's degree in Agronomy from Purdue University. He is working on high-throughput phenotyping of maize traits and crop growth modeling. The overarching goal of his work is to integrate genomic prediction with parameters from high-throughput phenotyping into crop growth models to estimate the performance of unobserved genotypes in unobserved environments, which is a promising approach to improving prediction accuracy of complex traits in plant breeding and genetics.
