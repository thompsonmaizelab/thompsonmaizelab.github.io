### Overview
Robert completed his B.Sc in Plant Genetic, Breeding, and Biotechnology at
Purdue University. Currently, Robert is studying and developing multi-objective
optimization strategies for applications in plant breeding. He hopes that his
work can be used to improve crop development when there are multiple traits
that need to be improved simultaneously.

### Current projects
Currently, Robert is working on the development of an open-source software that
can be used to simulate and optimize plant breeding pipelines. The first version
of this software has been completed, but he is working on writing up the
publication. Once the published has been completed, he will release the package
to the public.

### Future projects
In the future, Robert will be looking into testing several novel multi-objective
breeding strategies using the software package aforementioned.
