# About her
Dr. Anuradha is a postdoc in my lab. She obtained her Ph.D. from the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology jointly with the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute in India. Her research focuses on phenomics and genomic analyses of various agronomic and functional traits related to biomass and climate resilience in sorghum. She leverages natural genetic variations in a sorghum association panel to resolve complex trait variations at both the genomic and phenotypic levels. She employs manual and high-throughput phenotyping techniques, including physiological phenotyping, hyperspectral scanning, and multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle imaging, to phenotype sorghum plants at various growth stages in natural environmental conditions. Her research is crucial for predicting plant responses to specific environmental conditions, ensuring food security, and enhancing resilience in the face of climate change and evolving environmental challenges.
