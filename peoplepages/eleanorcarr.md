### Overview
Eleanor received her B.A. in biology and computer science from Kalamazoo College. In her PhD, Eleanor is interested in exploring the role of environmental conditions on the genetic control of traits in maize and potato. She hopes that her work, along with a passion for education, can help to lead to a more resilient and sustainable food system.

### Current projects
Currently, Eleanor is working on identifying genetic control of photoperiod in potato, as well as exploring environmental covariates that can explain differences in genotype performance across environments (GxE).

### Future projects
In the future, Eleanor will be working to develop educational materials and test their effectiveness in teaching introductory programming & problem-solving skills for graduate students in plant and computational sciences.
