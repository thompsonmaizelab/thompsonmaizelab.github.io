Dr. Tan received her PhD degree in Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology at Michigan State University in the summer of 2018. Her dissertation focused on examination of soybean sudden death syndrome resistance. During her doctoral work, a few main resistance QTLs and epistatic interactions were discovered and confirmed, and the associated markers are being used in the breeding program. In her current position, she is working as a postdoctoral research associate in maize genetics and genomics at MSU. Her integrated research focuses on predicting how different maize varieties perform in different environments, including abiotic stress and future climate change scenarios. Her work includes genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic prediction, high-throughput phenotyping, and crop growth modeling in maize and sorghum. She is also studying the application of drone-based spectral imaging in dry beans to assess biological nitrogen fixation.
