Eli is currently a master's student in the Plant Breeding and Genetics program. He completed his B.S in Botany and Plant Pathology at Purdue University. He is currently working on optimizing a diagnostic tool for detecting gene sequences in maize using gold nanoparticles. Additionally, Eli works on the development of a disease screening model for detection and differentiation of Fusarium spp. infected wheat based on image analysis.  He hopes that his research is able to assist plant breeders and scientist with improved efficiency in evaluating and making breeding decisions.
