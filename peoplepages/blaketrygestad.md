Blake graduated with a BS degree in Agronomy at Iowa State University in 2019 with an emphasis in Crop management and Plant Breeding/Genetics. Here at Michigan State he is studying maize host resistance to Tar Spot (Phyllachora maydis). Tar Spot is a new fungal disease to the United States as of 2015. The fungus has rapidly spread across the entire corn belt. This fungus causes raised hard black lesions on maize leaves causing rapid deterioration of the canopy, causing up to 50% yield loss in some areas. Blake's project is focused on finding host resistance to the disease in maize inbreds already in the United States. He is also looking into aerial detection of the disease from UAVs. Blake's hope is that his work will provide a defense for producers against this disease along with quick detection of the disease.
