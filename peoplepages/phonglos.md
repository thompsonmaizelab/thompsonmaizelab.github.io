Phong graduated with her BS from Michigan State with a major in human biology and has plans of pursuing medical school. Her project focuses on an isothermal alternative to PCR called Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). She's utilizing RPA in order to detect presence-absence variation in maize. Phong eventually wants to develop an amplification protocol that can be used in-field, in environments that lack electricity, or communities that lack the necessary resources for standard PCR. Additionally, she's genotyping and phenotyping mutant maize lines to determine if UniformMu insertions into candidate genes have an impact on seed phenotypes.
