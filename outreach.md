### Heirloom maize jewelry

We have a fascination with colorful maize kernels! Using tiny drill bits, we drill holes in corn kernels to use them as beads in jewelry making. At this time, our jewelry is for outreach and education with visitors, social activities, or charity events (including auctions), but not for direct sale through us. If you have received one of our pieces, feel free to send thank-yous to the makers and contribute images here. You can learn more about the heirloom varieties used in our projects here.
