Addie Thompson is an Assistant Professor in the Plant, Soil & Microbial Sciences Department at the Michigan State University, and affiliated with the [Plant Resilience Institute](https://plantresilience.msu.edu). She earned a BS in Genetics from Iowa State University in 2008 and a PhD in Plant Breeding and Molecular Genetics from the University of Minnesota in 2014, working in the lab of Dr. Gary Muehlbauer. Before starting her current position at MSU, she was a postdoc with Dr. Rex Bernardo at UMN and Dr. Mitch Tuinstra at Purdue University. Prof. Thompson's research focuses on using quantitative genetics, high-throughput phenotyping, and statistical and physical models to predict how varieties will grow in diverse and challenging environments, and to discover genes contributing to these differences. Most of this research is in maize, but the lab also has some projects in sorghum, dry bean, and teff. The lab is currently funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, Project GREEEN, Strategic Partnership Grant at MSU, Corn Marketing Program of Michigan, and the Plant Resilience Institute.
