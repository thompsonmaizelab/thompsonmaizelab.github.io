Joshua Schwartz is currently a senior at MSU studying Crop and Soil Science. Originally from St. Joseph County, MI, much of his agronomic experience is based on the extensive seed corn and other row crop production in that region. His interest in agriculture began with participation in the local FFA chapter and his work as a field scout for a local seed company throughout high school. More recently, Joshua also worked as a research intern at B and M Crop Consulting in Coldwater, Michigan, evaluating corn, soybean, and alfalfa trails. After graduation in May, he plans to continue his studies at Iowa State University and hopes to earn a Master's degree in Agronomy with a focus on applied data science in crop production systems.
